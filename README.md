## Hi there 👋

I’m an Android developer with over 2 years of experience in building high-quality and meaningful products mostly in startups.

I pride myself on having an artistic eye despite being “just” a developer and I love opportunities where I can utilize both the artistic and the technical aspects of my brain. Furthermore, I love being part of the Android community by networking with Android devs in annual conferences and writing blog posts on topics related to Android (medium.com/@waseefakhtar).

Interested in working together? Let's grab a coffee and talk tech, music, TV shows, or latest adventures.

### Skills 💻
- Languages: Kotlin (Advanced); Java (Advanced); Swift (Intermediate)
- Interests: Machine Learning; UI/UX; Photography
